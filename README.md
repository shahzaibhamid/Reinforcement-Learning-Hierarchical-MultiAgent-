# Reinforcement-Learning-Hierarchical-MultiAgent-
This repository is related to using Reinforcement Learning with the help of MATLAB.
This is written in C language logic and therefore is understandable for alomost anyone with programming knowledge.
There is a leader-follower approach in this which can be altered according to our objectives.
The main parts of this algorithm are Reward Function, Transition Probability, Policy Evaluation and Value Iteration.
These files are divided for leader and local agent.
This can be implemented in a number of techniques related to robotics.
